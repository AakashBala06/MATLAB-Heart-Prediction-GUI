# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Predictor App (MATLAB App Designer)

This is a medium-complexity healthcare machine learning project built using **MATLAB App Designer**. The app predicts the presence or absence of heart disease using a **Decision Tree classifier** trained on the UCI Cleveland dataset. It features a professional GUI with 13 user inputs, dynamic prediction logic, and visual result feedback.
